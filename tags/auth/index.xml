 Proposal I have many reasons why I fell in love with Go, when I started working with go there wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much packages at that moment, so basically you needed to built everything from scratch, this was a great experience because I learnt a lot of basic concepts related with client and server comunications, that I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn before in other languages because we used big frameworks such as Spring in Java.</description>
