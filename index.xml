      <description>The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before. &amp;ndash; Bill Gates
 Pagination One of the most common feature that we will face at some point as a backend engineer, is how to deal with pagination on the server side. Exists different ways for implement that, and as you can imagine, each one has it good and bad points. On this post I will try to implement the most basic one in Go.</description>

 Welcome and good morning! for all these people who is reading these lines and don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly why are you reading it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry I&amp;rsquo;m in the same boat.

      <description>Life  “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person&amp;rsquo;s point of view and see things from that person&amp;rsquo;s angle as well as from your own. Henry Ford”
 My name is Ramon Macias, I was born in Manzanares Spain, but I moved to a small town in the middleware of the Catalan Pyrenees when I was 1 year old. The passion for computer science started when I had my first computer, and as you can imagine, I used it for play video games, I was fascinated about how all these games can simulate some parts of the real world, and all these years there we have been seeing the evolution on the video games.</description>
